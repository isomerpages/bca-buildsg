<p>Part of a broader initiative by the Building and Construction Authority
(BCA), the iBuildSG Club is designed for students — from secondary schools
to junior colleges, ITEs, polytechnics and universities — who are curious
about the Built Environment (BE) sector. The Club offers exclusive opportunities
to explore, learn, and grow through hands-on experiences.</p>
