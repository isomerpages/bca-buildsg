<h4>The Pinnacle Competition 2025</h4>

<p>While buildings provide essential shelter and security, they are also major contributors to climate change and environmental challenges.</p>

<p>Today, they account for 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions, with 28% from operational emissions and 11% from the carbon footprint of construction materials and processes. (Source: <a href="https://worldgbc.org/climate-action/embodied-carbon/">World Green Building Council</a>)</p>

<p>Singapore drives sustainable development in the built environment through our Green Building Masterplan. With an ambitious target to green 80% of all buildings by 2030, we've already achieved a remarkable milestone – nearly 55% of our buildings are now Green Mark-certified.</p>

<p>While we have made significant progress in our green building initiatives, our journey towards our nation’s net-zero goal requires continued innovation and action.</p>

<h5>Visualising Sustainability: Reimagining the Built Environment</h5>

<p>As Singapore marks its diamond jubilee with SG60, we invite students to participate in an exciting video essay competition that brings to life stories about our green buildings or spaces - show us how they help the environment and makes Singapore a better place to live.</p>

<h5>The Challenge</h5>

<p>Create a 3-minute video essay about a Green Mark-certified building or space in Singapore.</p>

<p>Share your discovery of its green features and how they benefit both users and the environment. As we celebrate SG60, show how this building or space represents sustainable solutions for our community's future - think about how today's sustainable buildings are helping to shape the Singapore we want for the next 60 years.</p>

<p>The iBuildSG Club Pinnacle Competition 2025 is organised by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). Vero Marketing Services Pte Ltd is the appointed official administrator and coordinator for the competition.</p>
