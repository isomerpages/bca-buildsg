<p>Launched on 15 July, the Pinnacle Competition 2025 highlighted the creativity
and passion of students in showcasing Singapore’s Green Mark-certified
buildings. Through their video essays, participants reimagined how these
spaces can shape Singapore’s future, offering fresh insights and innovative
perspectives in celebration of SG60.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year’s entries stood out for their originality, storytelling and
thoughtful reflection on sustainability. More than just a competition,
it provided a platform for youths to share their vision for a greener built
environment and inspire others in the community. Shortlisted videos were
also showcased at the Building Singapore Festival held between 5 to 7 September
2025.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all who participated and congratulations to our Pinnacle
Competition 2025 winners! We look forward to seeing more innovative and
brilliant ideas in 2026.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
