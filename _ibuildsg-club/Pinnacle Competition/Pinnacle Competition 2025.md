<h4>The Pinnacle Competition 2025</h4>

<p>Did you know that our buildings in Singapore create more than one-fifth of our country's carbon emissions? Fortunately, we can make our buildings 'greener' to help fight climate change.</p>

<p>A new chapter in Singapore's environmental story began in 2021 with the Singapore Green Building Masterplan. This plan wasn't created just by the government – building experts and community members helped design it too. Think of it as a roadmap to make our buildings more environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>This masterplan is part of something even bigger called the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p>

<p>We've already made great progress:</p>

<ul>
	<li>By December 2024, more than half of Singapore's buildings have become more environmentally friendly. Imagine if you could lay out all the floors from every building in Singapore – 61% of this space now meets green standards.</li>
	<li>In 2024, about one in every four new buildings have been certified 'Super Low Energy' (SLE). This means these buildings are extremely good at saving energy.</li>
	<li>Our best-in-class green buildings are averaging 72% energy efficiency improvement compared to 2005 levels. These buildings now use significantly less energy to operate than similar buildings did in 2005.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Visualising Sustainability: Reimagining the Built Environment</h5>

<p>As Singapore marks its diamond jubilee with SG60, we invite students to participate in an exciting video essay competition that brings to life stories about our green buildings - show us how they help the environment and makes Singapore a better place to live.</p>

<h5>The Challenge</h5>

<p>Create a 3-minute video essay about a Green Mark-certified building in Singapore.</p>

<p>Share your discovery of its green features and how they benefit both users and the environment. As we celebrate SG60, show how this building represents sustainable solutions for our community's future - think about how today's sustainable buildings are helping to shape the Singapore we want for the next 60 years.</p>

<p>The iBuildSG Club Pinnacle Competition 2025 is organised by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). Vero Marketing Services Pte Ltd is the appointed official administrator and coordinator for the competition.</p>
