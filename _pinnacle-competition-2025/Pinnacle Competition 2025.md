<p>While buildings provide essential shelter and security, they are also
major contributors to climate change and environmental challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, they account for 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions,
with 28% from operational emissions and 11% from the carbon footprint of
construction materials and processes.</p>
<p>Singapore drives sustainable development in the built environment through
our Green Building Masterplan. With an ambitious target to green 80% of
all buildings by 2030, we've already achieved a remarkable milestone –
nearly 55% of our buildings are now Green Mark-certified.</p>
<p>While we have made significant progress in our green building initiatives,
our journey towards our nation’s net-zero goal requires continued innovation
and action.</p>
