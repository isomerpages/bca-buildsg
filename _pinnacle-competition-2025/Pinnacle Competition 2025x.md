<h4>Visualising Sustainability: Reimagining the Built Environment</h4>

<p>As Singapore marks its diamond jubilee with SG60, we invite students to participate in an exciting video essay competition that brings to life stories about our green buildings or spaces - show us how they help the environment and makes Singapore a better place to live.</p>

<h5>The Challenge</h5>

<p>Create a 3-minute video essay about a Green Mark-certified building or space in Singapore.</p>

<p>Share your discovery of its green features and how they benefit both users and the environment. As we celebrate SG60, show how this building or space represents sustainable solutions for our community's future - think about how today's sustainable buildings are helping to shape the Singapore we want for the next 60 years.</p>
