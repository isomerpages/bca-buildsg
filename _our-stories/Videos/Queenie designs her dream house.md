<p>What goes into designing and building a dream home? Join SGAG’s Queenie
(@qlyx) as she creates her “dream house” — with the help (and reality checks)
of three professionals from Singapore’s built environment sector. Through
fun and candid conversations, Queenie learns about the different roles
that come together to bring a project to life.</p>
