<p>Sayyid Harith Bin Mohd Haron (pictured above) has always been driven by
a strong desire to contribute to Singapore’s growth and future. When he
discovered the Built Environment Scholarship offered under the Singapore-Industry
Scholarship (SgIS), he saw it as the perfect opportunity to turn his aspirations
into reality.</p>
<p>Drawn to the Built Environment (BE) sector, Sayyid aims to work on initiatives
that improve the lives of Singaporeans, such as creating people-centric
housing estates, designing green spaces that foster community engagement,
and implementing smart technologies to enhance urban mobility and sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Navigating New Frontiers</strong>
</p>
<p>Sayyid’s interest in facilities management began during his polytechnic
years, where he pursued a Diploma in Aviation Management at Temasek Polytechnic.
His hands-on experience managing aviation facilities, such as airports
and airfields, provided a strong foundation in operational efficiency and
facilities management.</p>
<p>“I wanted to expand my expertise beyond aviation to explore the diverse
opportunities in managing facilities across various industries,” Sayyid
explained.</p>
<p>This ambition led him to pursue Project and Facilities Management (PFM)
at the National University of Singapore (NUS). At NUS, Sayyid quickly realised
that the skills he gained in asset management, safety compliance, and stakeholder
coordination during his polytechnic days were highly transferable to his
new field. The PFM curriculum broadened his perspective and skillset, preparing
him to contribute to projects that enhance Singapore’s built environment.</p>

<p><strong>A Global Lens on Urbanism</strong>
</p>
<p>During his undergraduate studies at NUS, Sayyid seized opportunities that
enriched his academic journey and solidified his career aspirations. One
standout experience was a Summer Studio Exchange on ‘Comparative Urbanism’
at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada. The programme,
co-organised by the NUS Department of Architecture, NUS Cities and the
UBC Urban Studies Department, included field trips, studio sessions, and
collaborative projects that provided valuable insights into sustainable
urban planning, cross-cultural collaboration, and innovative solutions
to urban challenges.</p>
<p>Sayyid envisions applying his learning to Singapore’s urban development,
particularly in projects that integrate blue-green infrastructure, enhance
community spaces, and improve urban resilience.</p>

<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
</p>
<p>Upon graduating in a few months, Sayyid will join his sponsoring organisation,
C&amp;W Services Singapore.</p>
<p>C&amp;W Services, the facilities and engineering arm of Cushman &amp;
Wakefield, brings over 30 years of expertise in facilities management,
engineering solutions, energy management strategies, and innovative facilities
management technology. As a fully integrated facilities management company,
it specialises in delivering end-to-end facilities services and property
management solutions. Sayyid is excited to contribute to diverse, large-scale
projects that will allow him to apply and expand his knowledge in areas
such as facilities operations, township management, and sustainable building
practices.</p>
<p>“The BE Scholarship aligns perfectly with my aspirations, offering not
only financial support but also opportunities for professional growth and
engagement with industry leaders. I also look forward to networking with
senior management and gaining rotational exposure across the company’s
various functions, which will provide me with a comprehensive understanding
of its operations,” he said.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Sayyid is enthusiastic about the transformative
potential of facilities management in Singapore, particularly with the
integration of robotics, automation, and data-driven technologies like
smart building management systems. He hopes to leverage these technologies
in his work at C&amp;W Services to contribute to projects that enhance
urban living and strengthen Singapore’s infrastructure for sustainable
development.</p>
<p>For students interested in applying for the BE Scholarship to work in
the built environment industry, Sayyid advises seeking internships or part-time
roles with construction firms, consultancy firms, or government agencies
to gain hands-on experience and problem-solving skills that will be invaluable
in the real world. “Networking is equally important—attend industry events,
connect with alumni, and engage with mentors or lecturers who can provide
guidance on navigating challenges like urban space constraints and integrating
smart technologies,” he added.</p>
