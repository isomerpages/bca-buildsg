<p>Shanmuganathan Kumaraval’s fascination with construction was ignited during
his formative years in his neighbourhood. "Growing up in Punggol since
2003, I saw the transformation of my neighborhood into the vibrant place
it is today," Shanmuganathan shared. "The construction of HDBs, condominiums,
shopping malls, schools, and the picturesque Punggol Waterway Park really
stuck with me."</p>
<p>His choice to pursue civil engineering at the National University of Singapore
(NUS) wasn't just pragmatic - it was deeply rooted in a childhood wonder
to fuse the beauty of mathematics with the practicality of physics to solve
real-world challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Laying the Building Blocks</strong>
</p>
<p>Shanmuganathan learned about the Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Singapore-Industry
Scholarship (SgIS) through a friend during his first year at NUS, and realised
the pivotal role it could play in helping him bridge the gap between theoretical
knowledge and practical experience.</p>
<p>"While our university education can give us a solid theoretical foundation,
contractor firms require continuous on-the-job training to excel as engineers,"
Shanmuganathan noted.</p>
<p>He decided to apply to join Woh Hup (Private) Limited, a leading construction
and civil engineering organisation, as its scholar through the MOE SgIS
Scholarship programme.</p>
<p>In Woh Hup, scholars will learn how their assigned function contributes
to the overall project delivery, even during internship. Besides interaction
with university seniors who are working in Woh Hup, scholars can engage
senior management through networking sessions and company events during
their internship.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging Theory and Practice</strong>
</p>
<p>Having interned as a Design Engineer with Woh Hup, Shanmuganathan shared
that he has benefited from the structured guidance given. His superiors
also supported his learning, sharing invaluable insights into identifying
and resolving issues that could arise at construction sites.</p>
<p>"As a year one student, my understanding of engineering principles was
still limited, but my superiors provided a structured learning path, outlining
key training objectives for me to achieve by the end of my internship,"
Shanmuganathan said.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his internship experience, Shanmuganathan said, “Now that
I am back at university, I can relate some of the concepts taught in class
with what I picked up during my internship experience."</p>
<p><strong>Building a Career in Construction</strong>
</p>
<p>Shanmuganathan believes that civil engineering is an ideal career choice
for those who wish to leave a meaningful impact on their communities. "It
may not always be an easy journey, but it will undeniably be a meaningful
and fulfilling one," he said.</p>
<p>Aspiring MOE SgIS scholarship applicants can take inspiration from Shanmuganathan’s
advice: "As a scholar, I am immensely proud to be part of a company that
shares my values and sense of social responsibility. My advice to potential
applicants is to consider not only a company’s professional reputation
and track record, but also its culture and values, as they will make your
journey with them much more fulfilling and meaningful."</p>
