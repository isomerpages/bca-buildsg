<p>Jeremy Loke (pictured above) was always fascinated by mega structures
like towering skyscrapers during his travels. They left a lasting impression
on him, sparking his curiosity about the engineering and processes behind
their construction. The sheer scale and innovative designs ignited his
ambition to be part of a team that plays a direct role in shaping the spaces
we live, work and play in. Jeremy made the first step in realising his
ambition by applying to join a forward-thinking organisation under the
Built Environment Scholarship.</p>
<p>Now a third-year Civil Engineering student at the National University
of Singapore (NUS), Jeremy is gearing up to join his sponsoring company,
Koh Kock Leong Enterprise (KKLE), after graduation. Jeremy is not alone
in this journey, as he draws inspiration and receives guidance from seniors
in the company. One such person is Koh Yong Zhi, a Project Engineer at
KKLE, who graduated with a Bachelor of Civil Engineering from NUS and was
inspired to join his family members who were already in the built environment
sector.</p>
<p>We hear from both Jeremy and Yong Zhi as they share their unique experiences
and insights into shaping the future of Singapore’s built environment.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy, what made you choose to pursue a career with KKLE?</strong>
</p>
<p>During my interview with KKLE, I learned about the company's transition
from a sub-contractor to a main contractor. This greatly piqued my interest
as I did not know of other companies undergoing such a transition at that
point. Being part of such a significant milestone offers great learning
opportunities and the chance to contribute meaningfully to the company’s
growth. I am motivated to play a key role in its development, striving
to be a crucial member rather than just another employee.</p>
<p><strong>That’s inspiring! How has your Civil Engineering degree programme at NUS helped fuel your passion for the built environment sector, Jeremy?</strong>
</p>
<p>It has provided me with a good foundation in engineering principles and
practical applications. Modules such as structural mechanics, geotechnical
engineering, and project management have deepened my insights into design
and construction processes. The hands-on projects and internship opportunities
have further enhanced my knowledge and fueled my passion, allowing me to
see my learning come into fruition!</p>
<p>I see myself using the skills and knowledge gained from my degree to contribute
to innovative and sustainable infrastructure projects that address both
current and future challenges. By applying principles of efficient design,
construction management, and sustainability, I aim to leave a lasting mark
on the built environment sector.</p>
<p><strong>Yong Zhi, what can juniors like Jeremy expect from KKLE’s ongoing transformation efforts in the built environment?</strong>
</p>
<p>At KKLE, we are transforming how construction and earthworks are done
by focusing on process optimisation, sustainability, and skill development.
While we specialise in earthworks and civil works, we are actively modernising
our operations to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<p>One of our key efforts involves adopting advanced equipment with enhanced
capabilities for greater precision and efficiency. We’re also leveraging
real-time communication tools and digital tracking systems to improve coordination
across teams, streamline project monitoring and optimise resource allocation.
These help to ensure timely and cost-efficient project delivery. Incoming
scholars like Jeremy will benefit from these transformational changes.</p>
<p><strong>What opportunities for professional growth have you gained at KKLE, Yong Zhi?</strong>
</p>
<p>At KKLE, I had the chance to work alongside experienced professionals
who have mentored me. The company has provided me with opportunities to
take on more responsibility and lead projects, which has allowed me to
grow technically and improve my leadership skills. Additionally, KKLE encourages
continuous learning, offering training and development programmes that
have helped me stay updated with industry trends and improve my expertise.
The exposure to diverse projects has been invaluable in shaping my career.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy, what advice do you have for students who are considering to apply for this scholarship?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Built Environment Scholarship not only helps to lighten our financial
burden but also prepares us well before entering the industry. It provides
access to internships where we can apply classroom concepts and gain practical
knowledge beyond academic learning. Additionally, it facilitates networking
with senior management and industry leaders, offering valuable insights
and connections. After hearing what Yong Zhi shared, I am really excited
about the upcoming opportunities and looking forward to being part of the
team to shape Singapore’s future landscape.</p>
