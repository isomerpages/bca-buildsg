<p>From an early age, Umar Abdul Aziz Bin Ahmad Shamsuddin has been fascinated
with how buildings were constructed.</p>
<p>"I recall the sheer delight I found in sketching my dream house and constructing
intricate buildings using Lego," he reminisced.</p>
<p>As he grew older, Umar decided to take up architectural studies at Singapore
Polytechnic.</p>
<p>"Architectural studies enabled me to develop a deeper appreciation for
the architectural and construction aspects of buildings. This love for
design and structure fueled my passion to explore the structural components
of buildings further," Umar reflected.</p>
<p>Umar also cites TV personality and Architect Khairudin Saharom as one
of his key inspirations in shaping his career path.</p>
<p>"Witnessing his remarkable talent and multi-faceted nature as a practicing
architect, bilingual host, and local actor, I learned the value of embracing
diverse interests," Umar explained.</p>
<p>Umar has since embarked on an inspirational journey of his own, aiming
to bridge the gap between architectural design and the technical aspects
of structural engineering. Today, Umar is a Structural Engineer with WSP
Consultancy Pte Ltd (WSP), a leading engineering professional services
consulting firm.</p>
<p><strong>A Transformative Learning Journey</strong>
</p>
<p>Combining his passion for design aesthetics with the technical feasibility
of implementation, Umar decided to pursue civil engineering for his bachelor’s
degree and went on to take a master's degree.</p>
<p>“I wanted to validate that the designs I envisioned would be structurally
sound," he added.</p>
<p>His unwavering dedication and exceptional academic performance as a student
in the Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering programme
at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), saw him being awarded the
Built Environment Industry Scholarship offered by the Building and Construction
Authority.</p>
<p>"The scholarship I received has played an invaluable role in supporting
my studies," Umar shared. “It has enabled me to dedicate myself to my academic
journey, allowing me to seize transformative learning experiences.”</p>
<p>The scholarship, coupled with his internship at WSP in his third year
of studies, cemented his desire to join the company upon graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Realising Career Aspirations</strong>
</p>
<p>Upon graduation, Umar joined WSP, he was given the opportunity to work
on groundbreaking projects that pushed the boundaries of engineering.</p>
<p>"I was fortunate to be involved in the world's first 4-in-1 Integrated
Rail and Bus Depot project," Umar said.</p>
<p>This hands-on experience exposed him to complex design and coordination
tasks, allowing him to apply the knowledge gained in university to real-world
challenges.</p>
<p>Umar also benefitted from WSP’s graduate development programme, which
offers support to help new graduates joining the organisation to achieve
their career goals. This comprehensive programme , which previously was
for a duration of 12 months and recently enhanced to 15 months, includes
tailored training to enhance technical and interpersonal skills, foster
holistic development, and groom and develop leadership talent. With WSP's
dedication to talent development, Umar has found a fulfilling career path
that aligns with his aspirations and ambition.</p>
<p>Currently, Umar is contributing his expertise as a Structural Engineer
to the design and development of the upcoming Cross Island and Jurong Regional
Line MRT stations in Singapore.</p>
<p>In his daily work, he uses software and other digital tools to enhance
his efficiency.</p>
<p>"Leveraging advanced engineering software for structural analysis and
calculations, we optimise designs, identify potential issues, and ensure
structural integrity with improved effectiveness and accuracy," Umar explained.</p>
<p><strong>Making an Impact and Embracing Growth</strong>
</p>
<p>Umar’s passion for his work has enabled him to find fulfilment in the
opportunities that allows for him to make an impact, fostering his personal
growth within Singapore's built environment sector.</p>
<p>“I find working in the built environment rewarding as individuals can
make a tangible impact, engage in problem-solving, and create long-term
positive change. Where there are opportunities for mentorship and guidance,
I aim to engage the younger generation and cultivate their passion in engineering.
Hopefully they too can have a fulfilling career path in the built environment
sector,” Umar shared.</p>
<p>This same willingness to share his time and personal experiences saw him
participating in a dialogue session with his SIT juniors last year during
the iBuildSG Built Environment Formation Programme (iBEFP), where he talked
about his career as an engineer and work in the built environment. The
iBEFP is an internship preparatory programme for students in BE courses
from Institutes of Higher Learning.</p>
<p>“What truly inspires me is the collaborative nature of the industry, where
professionals from diverse disciplines converge to shape the built environment.
Witnessing a project come to life, contributing to the city's development,
and making a tangible, positive impact on society is an immensely fulfilling
experience,” he expressed.</p>
<p>For aspiring individuals who are keen on joining the built environment
sector, Umar has these words of advice: “The built environment sector offers
a diverse range of opportunities. With dedication, passion, and a willingness
to learn, you can make a meaningful and impactful career in shaping the
urban landscape and creating sustainable built environments,” he said.</p>
