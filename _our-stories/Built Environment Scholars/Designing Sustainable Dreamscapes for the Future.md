<p>It's not every day that one gets to blend their passion with their hobby.
Meet Stella Wee, a Master of Architecture student at the National University
of Singapore (NUS), whose interest in architecture has led to a newfound
hobby: hiking. In her free time, you'll find her exploring natural landscapes,
neighbourhoods and buildings. It's her way of soaking in Singapore’s diversity
and deepening her understanding of the built environment.</p>
<p>Stella is more than just a student; she's a dreamer with a purpose. To
turn her passion into reality, she applied for the Singapore-Industry Scholarship
(SgIS) (Mid-Term) scholarship with DP Architects, a Singapore-based multidisciplinary
design firm with 17 offices worldwide.</p>
<p>We had the opportunity to hear from Stella on her passion for architecture
and her mission to create a lasting imprint on the built environment sector.</p>
<p><strong>What sparked your passion for architecture and led you to pursue it as a field of study?</strong>
</p>
<p>Stella: When I was young, I found it interesting that communal spaces
such as void decks and community centres have a significant impact on our
everyday lives. The relationship between spaces and how they shape our
lives and interactions with our surroundings is extremely meaningful. When
I was studying for my Diploma in Architecture, I was further inspired by
what I learnt from my seniors, tutor, and practicing architects, as it
opened my eyes to architecture’s endless possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a particular architectural building in Singapore that captivates you?</strong>
</p>
<p>Stella: Growing up in Tampines, I have a soft spot for Our Tampines Hub
as it was one of the first buildings to integrate a wide variety of community-centric
spaces. I remember spending time there studying, playing, and eating with
my friends after school. During weekends, the vibrant community spirit
resonates throughout the development with multiple events happening at
the atrium spaces. Till today, I find myself going back to it often. Seeing
the place filled with fun activities warms my heart and deeply inspires
me.</p>
<p><strong>What motivated you to apply for the Singapore-Industry Scholarship?</strong>
</p>
<p>Stella: When I first learnt about the SgIS, I was interested in the multitude
of opportunities it offered, such as internships, networking events and
workshops. Furthermore, the financial support the scholarship provided
allows me to fully immerse in my studies without worries. I felt that this
scholarship was one I could not miss out on.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to select DP Architects as your sponsoring organisation?</strong>
</p>
<p>Stella: I chose DP Architects as the firm covers a wide range of projects,
from commercial and residential to healthcare, offices and more. Their
belief in developing architecture for the people, with a strong focus on
sustainability, resonated with me deeply. I believe that with DP Architects,
I will have ample opportunities to grow and achieve my aspirations of designing
spaces that improve the quality of life and create a lasting positive impact
on our community and its wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about the NUS Masters Programme for Architecture. Are there any specific areas or subjects within the programme that have influenced your perspectives?</strong>
</p>
<p>Stella: It is indeed an extremely gruelling programme, as I find myself
pushing my boundaries to explore novel ideas. Nonetheless, it is a rewarding
process. I particularly found urban design interesting as it imparted values
on how architecture should not be viewed in isolation. It requires collaboration
between stakeholders such as architects, engineers, policymakers and even
the residents to create enjoyable spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead, what are your aspirations or goals in the field of architecture?</strong>
</p>
<p>Stella: One of my core motivations as an aspiring architect is to contribute
to projects with a significant social and environmental impact. By creating
dynamic and sustainable spaces, I am positive that architecture can be
enjoyed by everybody.</p>
