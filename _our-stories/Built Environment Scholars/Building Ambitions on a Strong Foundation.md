</p>
<p>Chua Gim Hock's foray into civil engineering wasn't sparked by an immediate
passion. Instead, it emerged from a gradual appreciation fostered by the
ever-evolving cityscape. "Seeing how rapidly our city’s skyline has developed
over the years made me appreciate the work done by professionals in the
built environment sector," he reflected. This appreciation sparked a curiosity
to unravel the engineering principles behind standing structures, naturally
steering him into the built environment for his career.</p>
<p>Motivated to carve a career path in the built environment, Gim Hock set
his sights on the Built Environment Industry Undergraduate Scholarship,
where he kickstarted his career with KTC Civil Engineering and Construction
Private Limited (KTC) upon his graduation.</p>
<p><strong>A Profound Impact for Growth</strong>
</p>
<p>The scholarship played a pivotal role in Gim Hock's education and career.
Reflecting on his undergraduate days pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering
in Civil Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, he shared that
the scholarship enabled him to focus on his education without worrying
about financial burdens. The scholarship also opened doors to valuable
experiences, from securing internships to networking opportunities with
senior management at KTC.</p>
<p>Gim Hock's journey of progress from an intern to a Project Manager at
KTC was marked by hands-on experiences, challenges, and a commitment to
continuous learning. The internship at KTC gave him a head start, offering
insights into the construction industry and project management. Embracing
challenges, from unexpected site issues to coordinating diverse teams,
became a cornerstone of Gim Hock’s career. Today, as a Project Manager,
he orchestrates seamless communication, fosters collaboration, and navigates
the complexities of adhering to strict timelines and budgets, to ensure
successful delivery of projects to his clients’ expectations.</p>
<p>In his quest to specialise further in the field of Civil Engineering,
Gim Hock went on to take up a Master of Science in Civil Engineering at
the National University of Singapore in 2018, thereby enhancing his geotechnical
knowledge and problem-solving abilities. His involvement in notable projects
such as Orchard Boulevard MRT Station and Sungei Bedok Station gave him
an opportunity to put what he has learnt into good use and showcased his
ability to tackle challenging situations faced in these projects.</p>
<p>"Constructing MRT stations in densely built-up areas is always challenging,"
acknowledges Gim Hock. The construction of an underpass linking Orchard
Boulevard Station to its entrances, situated just 2.5m to 5m beneath the
bustling Orchard Boulevard junction, presented a memorable challenge. We
spent many months designing, identifying, and evaluating the associated
risk and technical challenges. Eventually, we adopted Pipe Roof Methodology
(trenchless technique) as the solution and managed to complete the project
on time and within budget."</p>

</p>
<p><strong>The Fundamentals of Success</strong>
</p>
<p>Emphasising the paramount role of teamwork and collaboration for projects,
Gim Hock noted, "Teamwork and collaboration play a critical role in project
management as they foster effective communication and allow the exchange
of ideas and insights among team members regardless of seniority." This
synergy enhances problem-solving and decision-making, ultimately leading
to superior project outcomes.</p>
<p>He also believes in cultivating a supportive environment and instilling
values of hard work, adaptability, and innovation in younger engineers.
Reflecting on his role as a mentor, he shared, "Working hard and yet staying
adaptable and innovative are crucial values and skills that I will always
emphasise to young engineers, especially in the built environment industry
where change is a constant," he shared.</p>
<p><strong>A Nurturing Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>Gim Hock takes pride in being an integral part of the nurturing environment
at KTC. "KTC is like a family; providing a positive and inclusive work
culture that fosters a sense of belonging. Opportunities for professional
growth and skill development inspire employees to entrust their careers
with the organisation," he warmly expresses. Moreover, he highlights the
open recognition and appreciation from senior leaders, emphasising how
this boosts morale and creates job satisfaction for everyone in the organisation.</p>
<p>This positive work culture is not just Gim Hock's sentiment. KTC’s commitment
to its employees has also been recognised externally. The company has earned
its place among Straits Times’s ranking of Singapore's Best Employers,
a testament to its dedication to creating a supportive and fulfilling workplace.</p>
<p>In its role within the Built Environment sector, KTC strongly advocates
for workplace safety, quality of work, and competency development. The
company ensures that all staff are provided equal opportunities to excel
in their respective fields. KTC believes that by taking pride in their
work, employees will develop a strong sense of belonging, driving them
to continuously strive for excellence. At the staff level, KTC entrusts
staff engagement to department heads, the company actively demonstrates
care and concern, providing support whenever needed to keep the workforce
engaged and motivated.</p>
<p>Gim Hock's aspirations extend towards delving deeper into the development
of underground infrastructure in Singapore, with a focus on ingenuity,
sustainability, and technological advancement. His advice to aspiring engineers
echoes the ethos of the ever-evolving Built Environment sector: "Flexibility,
adaptability, and innovation are key traits to success," he said.</p>
