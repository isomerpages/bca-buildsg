<p>It all started with a visit to a built environment sector career fair
for Mohamad Saifullizan Bin Abd Rahman (Saifu).</p>
<p>He shared, “I came across the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP)
for BIM Professionals during the career fair and decided to apply. I had
a background in 3D Animation and thought it would be of relevance.</p>
<p>“I also saw good career prospects for BIM professionals as Singapore was
moving rapidly towards digitisation in the built environment sector.”</p>
<p>When Saifu was shortlisted and eventually accepted into the PCP, he joined
Lum Chang Building Contractors Pte Ltd. (Lum Chang) as a BIM Modeller.</p>
