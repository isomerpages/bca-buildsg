<p><strong>Q: What do you do as a structural engineer?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I collaborate closely with other project partners, such as other specialised
engineers to bring the architect's vision to life. As structural engineers,
we use digital tools to design the spine of buildings and infrastructures.
We also use digital tools to come up with multiple design options and improve
work efficiency. This gives us more time to interact with our clients and
collaborators.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception/s of what you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: People often think this job is dangerous, involves long hours, and
requires being outside in the hot weather all the time.</p>
<p>In reality, structural engineers typically manage projects in the office.
With new tools for remote supervision and monitoring, we can effectively
manage the project’s progress without being on site all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the key role of a structural engineer?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Our job is to ensure that a building is safe and stable. For example,
with iconic structures like Marina Bay Sands, the design poses unique challenges.
The Sands SkyPark, which is located on the rooftop, requires special structural
solutions to support its weight and balance.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the most practical structure may not align with the architect’s
vision, so we collaborate closely with them to find a solution that meets
both structural requirements and design intentions while ensuring cost
effective design and safety.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one interesting thing about your job?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Our work often involves details that might not be immediately visible.
For example, to ensure that Marina Bay Sand’s SkyPark structure was structurally
sound, we performed detailed analysis and conducted tests before it opened
to the public. In fact, a group of 170 people had to stand and jump on
it to excite the structure in order for the test to be conducted properly.
We used various instruments to measure its performance, and as expected,
it met all safety and comfort requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Seeing my projects come to life and how people engage with the spaces
we’ve created excites me the most. Having worked on Marina Bay Sands, I
can't help but be proud of the work my team and I did. It’s rewarding to
know that we are shaping a better world and bringing joy to everyone, driving
me to continue on this career path.</p>
