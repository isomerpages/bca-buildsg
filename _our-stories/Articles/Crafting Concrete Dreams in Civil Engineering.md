<p>Shanmuganathan Kumaraval’s fascination with construction was ignited during
his formative years in his neighbourhood. "Growing up in Punggol since
2003, I saw the transformation of my neighborhood into the vibrant place
it is today," Shanmuganathan shared. "The construction of HDBs, condominiums,
shopping malls, schools, and the picturesque Punggol Waterway Park really
stuck with me."</p>
<p>His choice to pursue civil engineering at the National University of Singapore
(NUS) wasn't just pragmatic - it was deeply rooted in a childhood wonder
to fuse the beauty of mathematics with the practicality of physics to solve
real-world challenges.</p>
