<p>Shanmuganathan Kumaraval’s fascination with construction was ignited during
his formative years in his neighbourhood. "Growing up in Punggol since
2003, I saw the transformation of my neighborhood into the vibrant place
it is today," Shanmuganathan shared. "The construction of HDBs, condominiums,
shopping malls, schools, and the picturesque Punggol Waterway Park really
stuck with me."</p>
<p>His choice to pursue civil engineering at the National University of Singapore
(NUS) wasn't just pragmatic - it was deeply rooted in a childhood wonder
to fuse the beauty of mathematics with the practicality of physics to solve
real-world challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What sparked your interest to join the built environment sector?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: My interest in the built environment industry was sparked during a
high school field trip to a construction site. Watching the intricate process
of transforming blueprints into towering structures was fascinating. The
combination of creativity and technical skill required in civil engineering
captivated me. Additionally, I realized the profound impact that well-designed
infrastructure has on communities. This experience ignited my passion for
civil engineering and motivated me to pursue a career where I could contribute
to shaping sustainable and functional urban spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s your roles and responsibilities?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: As a civil engineer, my primary role is to oversee the planning, design,
and construction of various infrastructure projects. This includes collaborating
with architects and other engineers to develop detailed project plans,
conducting site inspections to ensure compliance with safety and quality
standards, and managing project timelines and budgets. I am also responsible
for performing structural analysis and calculations to ensure the stability
and durability of structures. Additionally, I work closely with contractors
and clients to address any issues that arise during the construction process,
ensuring that the project is completed efficiently and to the highest standards.</p>
