<p>In this podcast with Yah Lah But, we dig deep into Singapore’s underground infrastructure with Er. Geoshua Tan, Vice President (Civil &amp; Infrastructure Engineering) at CPG Consultants. From his work on projects like the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) and the Bidadari land bridge, Geoshua shares what it takes to design infrastructure that’s built to last — and how climate change is reshaping the way engineers think and build. He also clears up some of the most common myths about the profession and reflects on what keeps him proud to be part of shaping Singapore’s future.
