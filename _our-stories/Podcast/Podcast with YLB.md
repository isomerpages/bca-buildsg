<p>In this episode, we dig deep into Singapore’s underground infrastructure
with Er. Geoshua Tan, Vice President (Civil &amp; Infrastructure Engineering)
at CPG Consultants. From his work on projects like the Deep Tunnel Sewerage
System (DTSS) and the Bidadari land bridge, Geoshua shares what it takes
to design infrastructure that’s built to last — and how climate change
is reshaping the way engineers think and build. He also clears up some
of the most common myths about the profession and reflects on what keeps
him proud to be part of shaping Singapore’s future.</p>

<p>In this episode, we sit down with Ar. Tan Szue Hann — architect, sustainability
expert, and firm believer that good design goes far beyond how a building
looks. Szue Hann shares what led him to architecture, how it blends art
and science, and the collaborative spirit among engineers and consultants
to making sure designs meet real-world needs. He also spotlights the “eureka”
moments that keep him inspired, and why, even in an age of automation,
the human touch still matters in shaping spaces that people live, work
and play in.</p>
