<p>BE Conversations is a series that highlights the stories and achievements of professionals from diverse disciplines within the built environment. It aims to facilitate dialogue and the exchange of ideas, with the goal to share information about the Built Environment to inspire the next generation of new and in-service professionals toward change and transformation.
<br>
<br>In our first episode, we introduce two remarkable women in the built environment profession who share their experiences of working in a predominantly male-dominated industry. They delve into the industry's inclusivity towards women, the opportunities it presents, the satisfaction they derive from their roles, and their motivations for excelling in their work.</p>
