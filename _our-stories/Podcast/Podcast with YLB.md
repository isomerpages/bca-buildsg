<p>In this podcast with <em>Yah Lah But</em>, we dig deep into Singapore’s
underground infrastructure with Er. Geoshua Tan, Vice President (Civil
&amp; Infrastructure Engineering) at CPG Consultants. From his work on
projects like the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) and the Bidadari land
bridge, Geoshua shares what it takes to design infrastructure that’s built
to last — and how climate change is reshaping the way engineers think and
build. He also clears up some of the most common myths about the profession
and reflects on what keeps him proud to be part of shaping Singapore’s
future.</p>
<p>This episode is part of a special two-parter in collaboration with <em>Yah Lah But</em>,
featuring the people behind Singapore’s built environment.</p>
