<p><strong>Q: What do you do as a cost consultant?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I manage costs and contracts which stretch across the entire project
lifecycle, from inception to completion. I also help clients set budgets
based on their project scope and oversee expenses, ensuring that the contracts
are awarded and completed at the right price.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception/s of what you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: People usually think my job is all about monitoring figures and numbers.
However, the digital era has transformed the job, enabling us to leverage
innovative solutions like Building Information Modelling (BIM) to optimise
resource allocation, adapt to evolving project requirements, and proactively
mitigate potential risks, revolutionising the way we work.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does one become a cost consultant? Can you tell us more about your journey?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: There are many ways to become a cost consultant. In Singapore, the
role can go by various names too, such as Quantity Surveyor.</p>
<p>My interest in this industry began with my father who was a contractor,
which exposed me to the industry. Given my interest in mathematics and
the availability of a suitable opportunity, I decided to pursue this role!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one interesting thing about your job?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: By collaborating with different professionals, including architects,
engineers, contractors and clients, I have the privilege of learning from
diverse different fields and projects, including industrial facilities,
healthcare institutions, and educational establishments. This helps me
better understand the complex design and building considerations behind
the infrastructures that we interact with daily.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I enjoy meeting people from different projects and working in a collaborative
environment. There's also a great sense of satisfaction in seeing a project
come to life, from initial drawings to the finished building.</p>
