<p><strong>Q: What do you do as a construction manager?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: As construction managers, we oversee projects focusing on four main
areas: time, safety, cost, and quality. At the site, we ensure that the
project stays on schedule by managing material delivery and manpower, monitoring
costs to ensure they adhere to budget constraints, maintaining high-quality
standards, and enforcing safety measures.</p>
<p>Productivity is improved by leveraging robotics and automation, such as
tile pointing machines, which automate the tiling process. Prefabricated
Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) also helps boost productivity,
where modules such as toilets are made off-site and assembled on-site,
reducing waste, reducing on-site manpower needs and enhancing safety.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception/s of what you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: People tend to have the impression that the construction process is
very labour-intensive. However, technology and innovation are transforming
the way we work, and the environment that we work in.</p>
<p>Tools now offer greater convenience and efficiency, and repetitive or
risky tasks are now performed with robotics or are automated. For example,
there are now robots that paint and lay floor tiles, allowing us to do
more with less.&nbsp; To enhance safety, we also use CCTVs for real-time
monitoring, which alert us to unsafe practices for immediate action.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does one become a construction manager? Can you tell us more about your journey?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: When pursuing my civil engineering undergraduate studies, I interned
at both consultancy and contractor firms which exposed me to both site-work
and desk-bound jobs. Over time, I discovered that I prefer the former over
the latter being an active person who enjoy outdoor activities. I was especially
attracted by the job scope of a construction manager at a contractor firm,
which provides a good balance of on-site and office work. So, after graduating,
I decided to pursue a career in a contractor firm.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one interesting thing about your job?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The Built Environment sector is always evolving, which means we have
to pick up and learn new skills and techniques to effectively tackle fresh
challenges.</p>
<p>Recently, I work on a project using a new method called top-down construction.
Unlike the traditional bottom-up approach, where we start by digging down
to the basement and building upwards, this method starts by building level
one first while simultaneously building upwards and downwards, saving considerable
time. It is also an engineering marvel, and a sight to behold!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Seeing a project evolve from concept to completion is incredibly rewarding.
Each day presents new challenges with consultants, clients, and authorities,
and solving these issues provides a strong sense of satisfaction. I also
take great pleasure in exploring innovative engineering methods to boost
productivity. Leading one of the first PPVC projects was challenging, but
overcoming those challenges and successfully implementing this new construction
method was particularly fulfilling.</p>
