<p><strong>Q: What does one do as an offsite production manager?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Traditionally, we install mechanical and electrical (M&amp;E) systems,
which provide ventilation, lighting, power and water supplies, at the construction
sites. In recent years, the sector has started building these systems and
modules offsite (also known as prefabrication) in a factory plant environment,
before transporting them to the site for installation. This approach speeds
up the on-site installation process and enhances safety significantly.</p>
<p>An offsite production manager is responsible for factory operations, and
liaises closely with suppliers and project stakeholders to ensure timely
production and delivery of the prefabricated modules.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception/s of what you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: A common misconception is that offsite prefabrication is only suitable
for specific types of buildings or locations. However, weâ€™ve been demonstrating
that modular construction can be applied to nearly all building types and
locations, as long as Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) services
are involved.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does one become an offsite production manager? Can you tell us more about your journey?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: There are two paths one can take to be become a production manager.
If you are technical or engineering trained, you can be a project manager
focusing on the design of prefabricated modules, As technical expertise
is essential to review design feasibility and managing the setup of these
modules.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can enter the field as a project manager without an
engineering background. In this role, you'll oversee budgets, schedules,
vendors, monitor onsite work progress, and coordinate with other consultants
and contractors.</p>
<p>For those interested in the M&amp;E roles in the Built Environment sector,
there are several routes to explore. Starting as an M&amp;E consultant
is common, where you design and advise on M&amp;E systems. Alternatively,
you could join a contractor to learn about traditional M&amp;E systems
and their installation. Another option is to work with a specialist firm
like TOM, where you can gain experience in organising and implementing
new M&amp;E solutions in modern buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one interesting thing about your job?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: People might assume that this job involves wearing safety boots and
helmets and is physically demanding. This misconception may deter some,
especially women, who might perceive the role as too rugged. However, most
of the work has shifted away from construction sites to a manufacturing
facility. This change makes the job much more manageable, with regular
working hours and a more controlled environment.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The Built Environment sector is often perceived as lagging when it
comes to innovation. On the contrary, countries like the United States
and the United Kingdom have been advancing innovative building practices
for decades and in Asia, we are also adopting more and more innovative
building practices, especially in the past five years. At TOM, we are always
seeking innovative solutions and having the opportunity to be among the
first to introduce M&amp;E off-site production in Singapore was thrilling.</p>
