<p><strong>Q: What do you do as a project manager?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I oversee the end-to-end process of the company's building developments,
from land acquisition, product development, procurement, construction,
to the completion of the project. We ensure that the projects complete
safely, on time, within budget and are of quality.</p>
<p>This involves coordinating with a multi-disciplinary team of consultants
such as architects, engineers, cost consultants and specialists to ensure
that each project progress in accordance to the project’s brief and regulatory
requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception about your role?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Project management is often misunderstood as primarily overseeing and
delegating tasks, but my role extends far beyond these. It involves being
hands-on in all aspects of the project, effectively identifying and mitigating
risks, adapting to evolving requirements and making informed decisions
promptly. All these contribute to the success of our projects.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can one become a project manager? What got you started in this?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I started as an architect, but the transition to a project manager
was seamless for me. Architecture provided me with a solid foundation in
design process and knowledge of regulatory requirements. Prior experience
in contract administration and hands-on coordination with contractors are
also useful in project management.</p>
<p>Individuals with other backgrounds such as engineering or quantity surveying,
coupled with practical sector experience will also thrive in this role.
An effective project manager is proactive, has the ability to size up situations,
target issues, problem-solve and at the same time work within time, site,
and budget constraints.</p>
<p>There are ample opportunities for people who are looking for a lateral
career switch in the sector, and this diversity of people with different
experiences will certainly add value to our sector.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one interesting thing about your job?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Turning conceptual ideas into physical realities. We are privileged
to witness up close how a drawing plan can transform, level by level, into
a building, forming part of Singapore's skyline - almost as if we are piecing
real-life Lego!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Teamwork and working towards a shared common goal with our consultants,
contractors and stakeholders in bringing the project from vision into reality
together. The camaraderie we experience overcoming challenges together
makes the feeling of seeing the eventual completion of our building projects
all the more fulfilling. The satisfaction of seeing how the buildings serve
the occupants well is also one aspect that I truly relish.</p>
