<p><strong>Q: What do you do as a sustainability consultant?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: We are the advocates and enablers of sustainable practices in our Built
Environment. We primarily provide advisory on energy and environmentally
efficient strategies across a building's lifecycle, comprising design,
construction, operation and even de-construction. The aim is to minimise
the carbon footprint of buildings, by optimising energy and water consumption,
assessing use of sustainable building materials, and ensuring end-users'
needs and comfort - all while ensuring financial feasibility!</p>
<p>We also stay up to date with the latest innovations that improve the efficiency
of our buildings as well as organize seminars and webinars to raise awareness
and advocate for green building practices within the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception/s of what you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Our role extends far beyond just paperwork and document submission.
We lead projects to design for energy and environmental sustainability,
which requires us to possess wide and deep knowledge of building systems
and construction products.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does one become a sustainability consultant? Can you tell us more about your journey?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: While studying environmental studies at the Singapore Polytechnic,
I took a module on Green Mark that piqued my interest. This led me to study
environmental engineering at university. After graduation, my continued
interest in building sustainability led me to join BSD, which provides
green building consultancy. Sustainability has gained prominence due to
BCAâ€™s initiatives and climate change concerns, providing ample opportunities
to deepen my expertise in the field.</p>
<p>A key part of what we do is to help clients and teams see the value of
sustainability, and challenging conventional design approach. This requires
critical thinking and an integrated, systemic perspective. Effective communication,
alongside empathy and adaptability are other soft skills that are critical
in initiating changes in mindset and behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one interesting thing about your job?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: One of the most interesting aspects of my job is being involved in
behind-the-scenes work that makes buildings more energy-efficient. For
instance, it is fascinating how small design changes such as relocating
a window to improve cross ventilation can significantly improve user comfort
and energy efficiency in a residential project.</p>
<p>Being a sustainability consultant exposes me to a diverse range of projects
from industrial buildings to high-security sites. It also offers a good
mix of desk and site work.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I value the versatility of my role, which exposes me to various aspects
such as costing, structural engineering, and architectural design. Seeing
projects evolve from design to completion and contributing to a greener
future provides me with a deep sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>I still vividly remember leading my first project, helping it achieve
the highest level of green building certification at that time. It was
rewarding and memorable, not just seeing it on paper, but subsequently
also seeing the green features that we incorporated working well.</p>
<p>At the same time, the supportive environment at my company allows me to
push boundaries and share my knowledge through part-time lecturing at BCA
Academy and by conducting webinars.</p>
