<p><strong>Q: What do you do as a facilities manager?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: I am a Key Account Manager, and I focus on facility management, environmental
services and oversee an operational team of about 120 members.</p>
<p>My daily responsibilities include managing internal and external stakeholder
relationships, ensuring that the facilities in the building are in good
and clean conditions, and serving the occupants well. I work closely with
my team to resolve on-ground challenges and collaborate with building owners
to support events or upgrading of facilities.</p>
<p>To enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, we constantly
review and improve our operations, by streamlining processes and integrating
new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception/s of what you do?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: There's a misconception that facilities management is mundane and dull,
limited to overseeing cleaning and maintenance tasks. In reality, it's
a fulfilling field that is data and science driven. Facilities managers
also manage and optimise the building's energy usage, while ensuring safety
compliance and security. In essense, facilities management is about creating
and maintaining facilities and building spaces to ensure that they are
safe, productive and sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can one become a facilities manager? What got you started in this?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: To become a facilities manager, apart from the educational requirements,
one would need a genuine passion in improving facilities with end users
in mind, almost like treating the facilities as one's second home. One
would also need good interpersonal skills to collaborate effectively with
key stakeholders.</p>
<p>My prior background in healthcare operations greatly facilitated my transition
to facilities management, and through regular upskilling, I get to hone
my expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What makes facilities management “smart”?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Our team leverages technology to streamline processes and make workplaces
and buildings more efficient, sustainable, and safe. We leverage real-time
data to monitor operations and proactively address issues, ensuring maintenance
is carried out ahead of time to prevent downstream problems.</p>
<p>Our data-driven approach is supported by the use of robots for laborious
tasks such as floor scrubbing and security patrols, further enhancing our
team's efficiency and safety.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: The people I work with make the job enjoyable and motivate me.</p>
<p>I also believe this industry has a lot to offer. I've seen it evolve over
the years, and with the introduction of new technology each year, there
is always something new to learn.</p>
