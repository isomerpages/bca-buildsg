<p><strong>Q: What do you do as a mechanical engineer and digital transformation practitioner / consultant?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: My work stretches across the project lifecycle, from planning and designing
the paths for mechanical and plumbing systems, to coordinating the assembly
of these systems. And of course, these are all done using digital tools,
such as a central digital platform, which enables seamless collaboration
between different project stakeholders. For instance, we are able to design
different functions and systems of a building simultaneously.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional engineering tasks, I employ digitalisation
such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) to visualise, plan and organise
the paths for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems within a building.
Another digitalisation tool is Common Data Environments (CDE) to manage
project documentation and communication efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception about your role?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Many people assume that I manage projects from start to finish. While
I do manage various aspects of projects, my core responsibilities lie in
digital transformation. I am actively involved in the technical and digital
aspects that drive project success, such as integrating new technologies
to improve and streamline processes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can one become a digital transformation consultant? What got you started in this?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: You should have a strong foundation in the Built Environment fields,
such as engineering, and a keen interest in technology. It is beneficial
to gain hands-on experience with digital tools and understand their applications.</p>
<p>I was first exposed to the wonders of digital tools and their applications
when I interned with Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) during my studies at
the Singapore Institute of Technology. The experience to handle and manage
JTC's digital collaboration platform allowed me to gain invaluable knowledge
in the digital field. Obayashi recognised my early exposure to digitalisation,
and provided opportunities for me to contribute to their digital strategies
and initiatives, and shape my role as a digital advocate in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one interesting thing about your job?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: It would have to be using virtual reality (VR) to visualise and interact
with project spaces. It provides realistic representations of complex designs,
and helps clients and stakeholders understand how the final project will
look and feel. VR can transform abstract design concepts into tangible,
immersive experiences, and thatâ€™s fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Embracing learning opportunities and experimenting with new methods
makes my role challenging, but rewarding. And having a company culture
that encourages open communication and innovation, and supportive supervisors
and management makes it even more motivating!</p>
