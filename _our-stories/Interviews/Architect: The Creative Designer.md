<p><strong>Q: What do you do as an Architect?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Designing buildings is just the tip of the iceberg. I take the lead
in the collaborative effort between builders, developers and consultants
to develop designs that meet the client’s needs, aesthetic and functional
requirements, and ultimately contribute to the betterment of communities.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the common misconception about your role?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Architecture is often perceived as only the visual aesthetics of a
building’s design, but there is so much more to it. We navigate a complex
set of technical and regulatory requirements, to ensure the perfect balance
between safety, end users' needs and comfort, and creative design. For
example, layout planning has to incorporate good circulation flow and meet
users’ requirements while considering fire safety and accessibility features.
And of course, construction details have to be coordinated with the contractors
to realise our designs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can one become an Architect? What got you started in this?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: You will need a combination of academic education and practical experience
– starting with a degree in architecture followed by internships and apprenticeships
to gain hands-on experience.</p>
<p>My path to architecture was driven by a passion for design and problem-solving.
My fascination with shaping spaces for live, work and play led me to pursue
a formal education in architecture, where I honed my skills and understanding
of the field.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is one interesting thing about your job?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Inspirations for my work can come from anywhere, even the most ordinary
things. Architecture isn’t just about the sheer design of buildings, but
also a tangible expression of local culture and identity. Through architecture,
I experience the world through unique lens which fuel my creative process
to overcome design challenges at work.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you enjoy most about your work?</strong>
</p>
<p>A: Seeing my designs come to life and make a real difference in people’s
lives isn’t just rewarding, it fills me with immense pride as the process
from initial concept to final project completion is often long and challenging.
It is especially fulfilling when we overcome challenges as a team and witness
end-users enjoying and benefitting from the spaces we created.</p>
