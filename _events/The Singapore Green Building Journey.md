<h4>National Library Building, Possibility Room View Map</h4>
<p>About This Event Singapore’s Green Building journey began in 2005. This
session with Professor Lam Khee Poh will look at some of the background
research and development work that led to the launch of the inaugural Building
and Construction Authority Green Mark Certification scheme.</p>
<p>The National Library Building will be used as a case study to illustrate
the conceptual and practical implementation of the key features of a Green
Building. A brief review of the several iterations of Singapore’s Green
Building Masterplan will also be presented, culminating in its contribution
to the Singapore Green Plan 2023, a whole-of-nation sustainability movement.</p>
