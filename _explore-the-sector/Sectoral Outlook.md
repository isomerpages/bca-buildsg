<h3>Transformation of the Built Environment (BE) Sector</h3>
<p>As we shape Singapore’s landscape, we also ensure that we are building
a sustainable and innovative future by focusing on digitalisation, green
building practices, and smart technologies.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Going Digital</h3>

<p><strong><sup>Source: Skills Framework for Built Environment</sup></strong>
</p>
<p>Our sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation to enable greater
efficiency, collaboration and innovations. Besides collaborative contracting,
which ensures projects incentives are aligned upfront between key stakeholders,
our partners have leveraged on technologies such as Building Information
Modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)
to revolutionise every stage of the construction lifecycle.</p>
<p>From the design stage, the <a href="https://www1.bca.gov.sg/regulatory-info/building-control/corenet-x" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CORENET X</a> platform
provides a common data environment that facilitates collaboration across
the sector. Visualising virtual environments, using IoT sensors to collect
real-time data and capitalising on advanced robotics and automation are
other examples of steps taken to improve quality and reduce construction
time.</p>

<h3>Going Green</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/so_going_green.png">
</div>
<p>With Singapore being a dense urban city, our buildings account for 20
per cent of our carbon emissions, and consume more than a third of our
nation’s electricity. This means that efforts to reduce a building’s carbon
emissions can go a long way in supporting Singapore’s drive towards net-zero.</p>
<p>Through the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, the sector aims to realise
these 80-80-80 goals:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Greening 80% of the gross floor area (GFA) in Singapore’s buildings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure 80% of new developments are Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best-in-class green buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the environment always coming first, great emphasis is placed on
reducing carbon footprint with every build. This has led to the emergence
of greener materials and technologies that will build a better future for
Singapore and for the world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Enabling Smart Buildings</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/so_smart_technology.png">
</div>
<p>Smart technology optimizes operations. Buildings are designed with ease
of maintenance as a key consideration, using smart facility management
technologies, such as robotics and automation, and intelligent building
management systems.</p>
<p>The sector is also increasingly integrating facility management services
within each building, and aggregating services across buildings, to yield
greater productivity and cost savings.</p>
