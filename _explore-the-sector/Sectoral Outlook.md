<h3>Transformation of the Built Environment (BE) Sector</h3>
<p>As we shape Singapore’s landscape, we also ensure that we are building
a sustainable and innovative future by focusing on digitalisation, green
building practices, and smart technologies.</p>
<h3>Going Digital</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/image_going_digital.png">
</div>
<p>Our sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation to enable greater
efficiency, collaboration and innovations. Besides collaborative contracting,
which ensures upfront alignment of projects incentives between key stakeholders,
our partners have leveraged on technologies such as Building Information
Modelling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)
to revolutionise every stage of the construction lifecycle.</p>
<p>From the design stage, developers, contractors and regulatory authorities
steps are taken to optimise efficiency using the <a href="https://www1.bca.gov.sg/regulatory-info/building-control/corenet-x" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CORENET X</a> platform.
Visualising virtual environments, using IoT sensors to collect real-time
data and capitalising on advanced robotics and automation are other examples
of steps taken to improve quality and reduce construction time.</p>

<h3>Going Green</h3>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/image_going_green.png">
</div>
<p>Through the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, the sector aims to realise
these 80-80-80 goals:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Greening 80% of the gross floor area (GFA) in Singapore’s buildings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure 80% of new developments are Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best-in-class green buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the environment always coming first, great emphasis is placed on
reducing carbon footprint with every build. This has led to the emergence
of greener materials and technologies that will build a better future for
Singapore and for the world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Adopting Smart Technology</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/image_smart_technology.png">
</div>
<p>Smart technology optimises operations. In addition to designing buildings
with maintainability as a key consideration, the sector is aggregating
facility management capabilities across buildings, in areas of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building automation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy management systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various cutting-edge advancements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Artificial intelligence tools also allow for the integration of building
systems on a single platform which benefits the residents.</p>
