<p>Singapore’s built environment epitomizes innovation and sustainability,
shaping the city state’s urban landscape with a focus on smart technologies,
green building practices and digitalization.</p>
<h3>Going Digital</h3>
<p></p>

<p>The sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, leveraging technologies
such as Building Information Modelling, Internet of Things and artificial
intelligence to revolutionize every stage of the construction lifecycle,
enabling greater efficiency, collaboration, and innovation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many parties&nbsp; are involved in the design, construction, and maintenance
of any building or infrastructure. For efficiency, building projects can
now visualise and simulate in virtual environments before construction
begins, while IoT sensors collect real-time data on building performance
and occupancy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prefabrication and modular constructions are enhanced through advanced
robotics and 3D printing, improving quality and reducing constructing time.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Going Green</h3>

<p>Through the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, the sector sets to realise
the 80-80-80 goal;</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Greening 80% of the gross floor area (GFA) in Singapore’s buildings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>80% of new developments to be Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best-in-class green buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Taking an environment-first approach, there is great emphasis on the carbon
footprint of our work, which led to the emergence of greener materials
and technologies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sector constantly looks at ways to further reduce our carbon footprint,
and this presents opportunities to innovate and build more sustainably,
creating a better future for Singapore, and for the world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Adopting Smart Technology</h3>
<p></p>

<p>Smart technology optimize operations. The sector&nbsp; adopts building
automation and energy management systems&nbsp; and various cutting-edge
advancements,&nbsp; to enhance the management of a building’s facilities.
Tools like artificial intliigence allow for the monitoring of building
systems on a single platform, which also translates to benefits for our
end users.&nbsp;</p>
