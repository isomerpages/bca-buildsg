<h3>Transformation of the Built Environment (BE) Sector</h3>
<p>As we shape Singapore’s landscape, we also ensure that we are building
a sustainable and innovative future by focusing on smart technologies,
green building practices and digitalisation.</p>
<h3>Going Digital</h3>

<p><strong><sup>Source: Skills Framework for Built Environment</sup></strong>
</p>
<p>Our sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation to enable greater
efficiency, collaboration and innovations. Some of the technologies our
partners have leveraged on include Building Information Modelling, Internet
of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionise every
stage of the construction lifecycle.</p>
<p>From the design stage, steps are taken to optimise efficiency. Visualising
virtual environments, using IoT sensors to collect real-time data and capitalising
on advanced robotics and 3D printing are steps taken to improve quality
and reduce construction time.</p>

</div>
<p>Through the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, the sector aims to realise
these 80-80-80 goals:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Greening 80% of the gross floor area (GFA) in Singapore’s buildings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure 80% of new developments are Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best-in-class green buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Adopting Smart Technology</h3>

<p><strong><sup>Source: To insert source picture here</sup></strong>
</p>
<p>Smart technology optimises operations. To enhance the management of a
building’s facilities, the sector has adopted:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Building automation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy management systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various cutting-edge advancements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Artificial intelligence tools also allow for the monitoring of building
systems on a single platform which benefits the residents.</p>
