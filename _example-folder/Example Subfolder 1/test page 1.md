# Test HTML CODE

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-between;">
    <div style="width: 48%; padding: 20px; box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: #f9f9f9; border-radius: 5px;">
      <img alt="Architects" src="/images/architects.jpg">
      <h2>Architects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Design buildings that endure across time, anchor our national identity, and shape our urban landscape.</li>
        <li>Work closely with stakeholders (e.g., developers, authorities) to ensure that building design meets project objectives and regulatory requirements.</li>
        <li>The job of an Architect has evolved over time. For example, designs are now done in 3D using Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. Architects can also harness data analytics to optimize building layout and design, to support user needs and meet other objectives such as sustainability goals.</li>
      </ul>

      <img alt="Engineers" src="/images/civil_structural_electrical_mechanical_engineers.jpg">
      <h2>Engineers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Design structural, mechanical, and electrical elements of buildings to ensure that they are safe and durable for occupation, and meet evolving infrastructure needs.</li>
        <li>Ensure works are carried out according to design plans during the construction phase.</li>
        <li>Engineers help push the envelope for sustainability by integrating building design with resource-efficient technologies. This includes the use of computational fluid dynamics to simulate wind flow within the building for optimal natural ventilation.</li>
