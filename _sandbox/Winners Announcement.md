<p>Launched on 15 July, the Pinnacle Competition 2025 highlighted the creativity and passion of students in showcasing Singapore’s Green Mark-certified buildings. Through their video essays, participants reimagined how these spaces can shape Singapore’s future, offering fresh insights and innovative perspectives in celebration of SG60.</p>

<p>This year’s entries stood out for their originality, storytelling and
thoughtful reflection on sustainability. More than just a competition,
it provided a platform for youths to share their vision for a greener built
environment and inspire others in the community. Shortlisted videos were
also showcased at the Building Singapore Festival held between 5 to 7 September 2025.</p>

<p>A big thank you to all who participated and congratulations to our Pinnacle Competition 2025 winners! We look forward to seeing more innovative and brilliant ideas in 2026.</p>
